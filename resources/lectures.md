[Week 2](#week-2-object-oriented-programming)

[Week 3](#week-3-databases)

## Week 1: Ruby

#### Monday
* **<a name="github-based-challenge-system"></a>Intro to GitHub-based Challenge System:**

  During their first day at DBC, students are given an introduction to DBC and an overview of how to operate at DBC.  The majority of this information is delivered by Dave and Alex.  It is the responsibility of the instructors to walk students through the use of the cohort's GitHub organization.  At a minimum, students should be walked through the phase guide and shown how to submit a challenge.


#### Tuesday
* **<a name="rspec-basics"></a>Rspec Basics:**

  Intro to basic concepts behind testing: writing examples and example groups, identifying edge cases, what to test, running the tests.


#### Wednesday

* **<a name="iteration-and-recursion"></a>Iteration and Recursion:**

  Introduce students to the idea of algorithms, steps for solving a problem.  Students should be given an introduction to both iteration and recursion.  With iteration, students should be informed of (1) looping, and (2) iterating over collections.  With recursion, students should be informed of (1) breaking a problem down into smaller, solvable problems; (2) a method calling itself; (3) the base case.  Working in their weekly groups, students should write algorithms for solving a simple problem (e.g., detecting palindromes) both iteratively and recursively.


#### Friday

* **<a name="sudoku-workshop"></a>Sudoku Workshop & Group Dynamics:**

  Before students begin, make sure that all students are familiar with the rules of Sudoku.  This will be their first group challenge.  Discuss working on code in teams.



## Week 3: Databases

#### Monday

* **<a name="schema-design-workshop"></a>Schema Design Workshop:**

  Lead students through a workshop where, working in teams, they will recreate the database schema for a popular website (e.g., flickr).
