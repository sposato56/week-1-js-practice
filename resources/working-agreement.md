# Working Agreement

### Core Hours Overview
- You will meet with your accountability buddies at 8:45 am every week day; text or call your buddies if they are not present or if you are running late.

- Core hours are 9:00 am - 12:30 pm and 2:00 pm - 6:00 pm.  You are expected to be onsite and ready to work during this time.  If you have extenuating circumstances, let your instructors know as soon as possible.  During lunch, 12:30 pm - 2:00 pm, you are free; however, there may be days when you are asked to be onsite during lunch (e.g., for assessment review).

- At 9:00 am and 2:00 pm we will meet in the lecture area for announcements.

### Phase 1 Priorities
