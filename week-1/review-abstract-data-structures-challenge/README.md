# Build an Abstract Data Structure

## Summary
Ruby's core library provides us with some built in data structures.  Arrays and hashes are two fundamental data structures, and both are provided by Ruby.  We've used them extensively, and we'll continue to do so.  These data structures are very flexible, and we can use them in a variety of different circumstances.  However, sometimes our program would benefit from a different data structure choice.

In this challenge we're going to learn about some additional data structures.  We'll select one of our choice and implement it in Ruby.


### Data Structure Choices
Choose an [abstract data structure][wikipedia abstract data type] from the following list.  Depending on which data structure we choose to implement, there are certain restrictions within which we'll need to work.  For more information on these data structures, check the information on [Wikipedia's list of data structures][wikipedia data structures list].

- Graph
- Map ([restrictions][map restrictions])
- Set ([restrictions][set restrictions])
- String ([restrictions][string restrictions])
- Tree


## Releases
### Release 0: Describe the Data Structure
In 3 or 4 sentences of our own words, describe the major functions of the data structure.


### Release 1: Implement the Data Structure
Implement the data structure and its primary functionality, adhering to the restrictions outlined above.  Depending on which structure we implement, we'll almost certainly either be using a Ruby `Hash` or `Array` behind the scenes.

We'll need to write tests that document the behavior of our data structure.


### Release 2: Describe Use Case
Describe a programming problem that we could model with our data structure and how the model represents the problem situation without exposing unnecessary data or methods.


## Conclusion
At Dev Bootcamp we'll primarily work with Ruby's built-in arrays and hashes.  However, we should be familiar with other data structures as well.  We never know when they might be useful, or when an interviewer might ask us about them.
